"""
This is a file that combines all the small scripts I used earlier.
This is being written so that I can use general paths to the catalogs of 
interest isntead of hard-coding in paths to certain catalogs.

Note: the 'richness calibration' is in old_files/ and the 'mass calibration'
is in old_files/SV_version.
