Here I am doing the calibration on the fox simulation for the DES cluster analysis. This directory contains the following:

- routines for calculating the halo-matter correlation function from pre-built halo catalgos at given snapshots
- routines for turning the HMCFs into DeltaSigma profiles
- routines to associate each DeltaSigma profile with covariance matrices provided to me from Tamas
- analysis routines very similar to those used in the real analysis, but with only mass as a parameter, used to fit the DeltaSigma profiles

The first three steps are done, and the last step is in progress.
